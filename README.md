# Repository Template

This is a template that you can apply to quick start a project. It contains:

- A default [.gitignore](./.gitignore) file with standard definitions.
- This [README.md](./README.md) file, the onboard content for your project.
- The [LICENSE](./LICENSE) defined by the Innersource team.
- Standard [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines. In case you need it, here is a [useful guide to build a new one](https://github.com/philips-internal/git-guide/blob/main/Tutorial/Creating%20Contribution%20Guidelines.md).
- A [CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) based on Contributor Covenant, an open source project.
